Welcome to my digital garden.
I'm Nicholas, a 5th year Computer Science and Math student at the University of Toronto.
I have hoped to find a place to consolidate many of my thoughts -- many people refer to these digital scapes as a "second brain".
I will be sharing my thoughts and interests in different topics of [[computer-science | Computer Science]], [[mathematics | Mathematics]], and generally other things I find interesting.

## About Me

I am a student at the University of Toronto in my 5th year of undergrad, studying for a Computer Science and Math double-major degree (technically going for a specialist in CS).
I am interested in [[deep-learning | Deep Learning]] and pure math.
I hope to learn a lot more about these topics and make considerable contributions to research in the fields of deep learning and more specifically [[natural-language-processing | NLP]] in the future.

I have a moderate amount of web design, full-stack, game, system, and mobile development experience.
